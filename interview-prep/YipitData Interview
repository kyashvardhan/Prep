YipitData Interview: Last-Minute Q&A Sheet

Q: Tell me about yourself
I'm a Computer Science graduate with an honors in Data Science. After graduation, I explored freelancing
instead of taking a job right away. I worked on real projects as a developer, strategist, and designer. Through
this, I realized I genuinely enjoy organizing and working with raw data. That's what led me to apply for this
Data QA role at YipitData.

Q: Why do you want to work at YipitData?
YipitData transforms messy, unstructured data into meaningful insights - and I find that very powerful. I also
connect with the company values like ownership, clear communication, and continuous learning. It feels like a
place where I can grow and contribute meaningfully.

Q: Walk me through your resume / What did you do after graduation?
After graduating, I chose to explore multiple domains through freelancing - web development, UI/UX, video
editing, YouTube strategy. I worked with clients globally, built skills, and realized I love working with data.
Now I'm ready to apply those experiences in a structured team environment.

Q: What skills do you bring to this role?
Three things: 1) Attention to detail - from working with raw data and content, 2) Clear communication - from
managing freelance clients, and 3) Problem solving - I enjoy figuring things out and staying calm under
pressure.

Q: Tell me about a time you made a mistake.
I once published a client video with the wrong thumbnail and tags. I took responsibility, fixed it, and started
using a checklist before every upload. It taught me to double-check and slow down.

Q: Tell me about a challenge you faced.
I was once given messy blog data to clean and tag without clear instructions. I created a system in Excel,
used Regex, and cleaned everything manually. The client loved it, and I learned how to bring order to chaos.

Last-Minute Q&A Sheet
Q: How do you handle repetitive tasks?
I break them into small batches, create systems or use tools like Excel or Regex to make them efficient. I
even turn them into small challenges to stay engaged.
Q: How do you manage time and deadlines?
I plan backward from the deadline and break tasks into small milestones. I've used tools like Notion and
Trello during freelance work to stay organized.
Q: What would you do if there was a sudden drop in vendor data?
I'd first re-check the source to make sure it's not a system issue. Then I'd compare it with previous weeks and
look for pattern changes. If it's unclear, I'd document it and raise it for review.
